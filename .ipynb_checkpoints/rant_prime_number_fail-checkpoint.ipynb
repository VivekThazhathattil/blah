    "So I was thinking about something for the past few days. All the universal constants (dimensional and otherwise) looks ugly. There isn't anything elegant about these numbers. Just ugly ugly numbers. Speed of light in vacuum, universal gravitational constant, pi, Euler's number - all of them looks bad. Was it the plan of the creator of this universe to assign such bullshit random numbers and keep track of them in his/her/its little journal? Obviously not, because that's a dumb thing to do and the guy/entity/whatever isn't dumb as we all know. That means that there is indeed an elegance to these numbers in their original form, but we as humans are the dumb ones (as usual) who are incapable of perceiving it."

Maybe there is something more to it, that my puny brain can't even think of! But imagine the scenario when we use the right number system and the right units and the right whatever-the-fuck-it-is and we finally get beautiful looking numbers in place of the currently hideous ones!

    "We are using systems that should have long gone obsolete by now. The only reason we are keeping it is because they are popular. An analogy would be to compare famous pop singers who recycle the same generic shit year after year, month after month, day after day, vs the unpopular ones who actually know how to sing and has a bit of creativity. Most people won't actively venture out to discover and listen to the seemingly hidden but wonderful songs by these unpopular fucks. General public has chosen to run their brain on autopilot - which knows only one thing and that is to follow the herd. I don't exactly know if this is the case, but aren't we using decimal system simply because we have 10 fingers? Imagine that we were three toed creatures. Wouldn't that make us use a senery number system (base 6)? Same goes for 'time' as well. Our ancestors used earth's rotation and revolution and all those fancy constellations and its periodic repetition as means of marking the passage of time, seasons and what not! Does that mean that we should follow it even now? It IS the way to go forward if we didn't bother about anything other than our immediate surroundings, but it is simply not sufficient! Time should get a suite of better units than the hour, min, seconds bullshit."

    "Like the lazy idiot that I am, instead of studying or completing my work, I spent the last 2-3 days looking for obscure patterns in number systems. If I wasn't lazy enough, I would have read through some stuff from number theory, but the sheer depth and complexity of the subject repelled me. Instead I watched some math videos on Youtube :) - specifically related to non-dimensional constants and their very interesting properties and connections with each other. I was watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9oPqBeSsZA) video titled 'The hidden link between Prime Numbers and Euler's Number' and was scribbling some random bullcrap in my notebook when I stumbled upon an interesting shit. I'm pretty sure that I'm not the first loser to observe this and the other losers before me should have come to notice this and went ahead to prove it and squeeze it to extract every bit of life out of it. But I haven't yet tried looking for these ideas in literature because I thought \"Hey, lets see how far I can go with this and eventually misinterpret and feel miserable!\"."

For example, take the prime number key 5 in the dict. The corresponding value is 11, which if it were in decimal system is a prime number. Similarly for 11:23, 13:31, 17:101 etc. So basically all the prime numbers in decimal system has equivalent decimal prime representation in the quarternary system.
